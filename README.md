# Problem statement.
For two different datasets - 1 coloured and 1 b/w, make classifiers.
After making the classifiers do attacks on the classifiers and break their accuracy. 
After breaking them, try to improve them with atleast one generative model and some recent techniques.

# Our works
* Classifier built one Kuzushiji - MNIST and CIFAR-10. For Kuzushiji, the architecture and the Keras/Pytorch Code can be found here 
  [Kuzushiji](https://github.com/bhattg/KUZUSHIJI-)
* We then did FGSM, PGD and CW attacks to break the classifier
* Finally, taking the inspiration from the Defense GAN, where we solve an optimization problem on the z space,
we tried to do 1 Nearest Neighbour for 10000 images generated by the Decoder of the VAE. The nearest images after the
KNN is the closest image in the data manifold to the adverserial example.
<br/>
**The KNN is much faster as compared to solving an optimization problem. Thus, we think that on the execution time, 
if we take less noise instances then this can be done in the real time.**
<br/>
* The report can be found [here] (Report.pdf)
